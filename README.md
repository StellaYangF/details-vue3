# Vue3 Handwriting

## Aims

This repository aims to record the learning details of Vue3, personally. So there are unavoidably some misunderstanding or errors to the source code. If you have any questions, feel free to tell me, which will be warmly appreciated.

## Packages

Since the source code is split into several packages. Here are the relative documents of the main packages. See from the following:

- `reactive`
- `runtime-core`
- `runtime-dom`
- `compiler-core`
- `compiler-dom`

## Plugins
These are also called the ecosystems to Vue3.x.

- pinia
- vue-router
- ...
